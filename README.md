# AI Interview SDK

Open-source TypeScript/React infrastructure for embedding AI-powered
interviews into any application — with your own AI keys, backend, and
database.

> **Status:** mid-build (through Phase 6). `@interview-sdk/core` (flow,
> evaluation, rubric, follow-up engines), all 5 provider adapters
> (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Deepgram, ElevenLabs), `@interview-sdk/react`
> (`InterviewWidget`, `MicButton`, `QuestionCard`, `ReportCard`,
> `TranscriptViewer`, `ScoreSummary`), `@interview-sdk/server`
> (production-mode evaluation, score signing, HMAC-signed webhooks), and
> `@interview-sdk/cli` (`init`, `simulate`, `bias-harness`, `pack`) are
> implemented and tested — see [Build Status](#build-status) below.
> `coding` is still scaffold-only. This README will get its full
> public-facing pass (badges, quick start, positioning) once the SDK
> actually works end-to-end.

## What this is — and isn't

- **The SDK is:** a developer tool you install into your own app.
- **The SDK is not:** an interview platform, a SaaS product, or a data
  controller. The maintainers never see, store, or process candidate data.

## Zero-Infra Guarantee

The maintainers never pay for backend compute or storage — not at 10 users,
not at 10,000. `@interview-sdk/server` runs on _your_ infrastructure. The
Interview Simulator and Bias Testing Harness run locally or in _your_ CI. The
only maintainer spend is the domain name. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
for what this means for anyone proposing a new feature.

## Architecture

```
Developer App (React)
        │
        ▼
@interview-sdk/react   ← UI components, hooks
        │
        ▼
@interview-sdk/core    ← flow logic, evaluation, rubric, follow-up engine
        │
        ├──► Client Mode (prototyping): calls AI provider directly from browser
        │
        └──► Server Mode (production, recommended):
                    ▼
             @interview-sdk/server  ← runs in developer's backend
                    │
                    ▼
             Developer's DB + Auth + Storage

## Build Status

This repo is being built in phases; each phase ships as its own reviewed
increment:

- [x] Phase 0 — Plan
- [x] Phase 1 — Repo scaffolding (this state)
- [x] Phase 2 — `@interview-sdk/core`
- [x] Phase 3 — Adapters
- [x] Phase 4 — `@interview-sdk/react`
- [x] Phase 5 — `@interview-sdk/server`
- [x] Phase 6 — `@interview-sdk/cli`
- [ ] Phase 7 — Coding Interview Mode
- [ ] Phase 8 — Docs site + examples
- [ ] Phase 9 — Final pass (edge-case coverage table, guardrail re-verification, README polish)

## Development

Requires Node >= 18.18 and pnpm (`corepack enable`).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build          # build all packages (tsup)
pnpm test           # run all unit tests (vitest)
pnpm test:coverage  # run tests with coverage
pnpm lint           # eslint across all packages
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit across all packages
pnpm format         # prettier --write
```
